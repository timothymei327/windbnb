## **_Getting Started_**

##### `Fork` and `Clone` the project, `npm install` dependencies in the root directory as well as in the `client` directory. Then, connect your mongoDB database via a connection string in a `.env` file on the backend.

##### Run `npm run dev` to spin up the backend server. Navigate to the client directory and run `npm start` to spin up the frontend.
